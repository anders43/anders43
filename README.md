ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anders. I normally code in C++ and C#. I started coding way back in 1980 and professionally since 1986. (GWBASIC, Turbo Pascal, C and lately just C++ with a dash of C#)

Currently (and probably until I retire) working at ABB where I fiddle with OPC and OPC. It is a great place to work at even though it has the problems that probably all bigger companies have, there is a lot of admin which seems to grow with each year (Parkinson's Law).

After retiremnt I will probably go all in on open source to keep my mind occuppied :)
